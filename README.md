# Vibe Watch Wi-Fi for Hermes

> **This fork:** Wi-Fi + voice chat with a self-hosted Hermes Agent instead of BLE + macOS. See [docs/HERMES_WIFI_SETUP.md](docs/HERMES_WIFI_SETUP.md).

All credit goes to the originators that I forked this repo from, my additions are miniscule but I hope they help someone.

**A wearable, tactile control surface for AI-assisted Vibe Coding—built around the M5Stack StopWatch.**

This README is outdated, but it gets the general gist across. I've incorporated multiple patches from other vibewatch repos, but the main change was to get this working over wi-fi instead of bluetooth, and attempt to keep the battery life still usable. Additionally, it supports multiple hermes swipable 'cards', and hermes statistics on tokens used per instance, etc. There is also an over the air update feature as a quality of life improvement.

## One Glance. One Action. Stay in the Flow.

Vibe Watch moves frequent AI-agent interactions away from crowded desktop UI and onto a dedicated wireless device. It keeps six agent states visible at a glance, makes approve/reject decisions physical, and puts Plan mode, assistant access, and push-to-talk on the wrist.

The goal is simple: spend less attention operating the AI and more attention creating with it.

## Why I Built It

Running multiple AI-agent sessions in parallel has become normal in Vibe Coding. That creates a new interaction problem: I want to know the instant a task finishes, select the right session, and speak the next prompt without searching across windows or returning to the keyboard.

After purchasing an [OpenAI Codex Micro](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/features/codex-micro), I was inspired by the idea of dedicated hardware for AI coding. I believed the experience could become even smaller, more glanceable, and more expressive by combining a round display with direct controls, motion, sound, haptics, and voice input. That idea became Vibe Watch: a wearable AI cockpit for parallel sessions.

## The Experience

The main **Agent layer** arranges six live agent indicators around the circular screen. Host-provided color, brightness, and animation communicate activity, while a fast spring motion moves the selection ring from one agent to the next.

Pressing both hardware buttons transforms the interface into the **Action layer**:

| Control | Experience |
|---|---|
| **FAST** | Triggers a quick action |
| **NG / OK** | Rejects or approves with distinct square-wave sounds and haptics |
| **PLAN** | Toggles Plan mode with a visible state change |
| **AI** | Invokes the assistant |
| **Center microphone** | Provides hold-to-talk control |

The orange left button maps to NG and the blue right button maps to OK. Colored rails visually join each physical button to its on-screen action, making the relationship understandable without instructions.

## Designed as One Multisensory Interface

Vibe Watch is not a macro pad with a decorative screen. Its visual motion, audio cues, vibration, touch controls, and physical buttons all describe the same interaction state.

- A rising square-wave phrase confirms **OK**; a descending phrase confirms **NG**.
- Pairing success is acknowledged with both sound and vibration.
- Agent-state updates can signal silently through adjustable haptics.
- Sound volume, vibration strength, and state-change vibration are configurable on-device and retained after restart.

## How the M5Stack Controller Is Used

The M5Stack StopWatch is the complete product interface—not a passive display attached to another controller.

- Its **ESP32-S3** runs the UI, preferences, battery monitoring, and Bluetooth Low Energy HID communication.
- The **466 × 466 round touchscreen** presents the six-agent spatial interface and action controls.
- The two **physical buttons** provide eyes-free navigation and approve/reject decisions.
- The built-in **speaker** and **vibration motor** provide immediate, recognizable feedback.
- The integrated **battery** makes the controller wireless and portable.

This tight hardware integration turns an off-the-shelf M5Stack controller into a purpose-built human–AI interface.

## From StopWatch to Wristwatch

Vibe Watch repurposes the official [Watch Accessory Kit for the M5Stick Series](https://shop.m5stack.com/products/watch-accessory-kit-for-m5stick-series) as a wrist mount. The kit is designed for rectangular M5Stick devices, so its plastic Watch Mount Accessory needs a small physical modification before it can carry the round StopWatch.

1. Remove the plastic mount from the device and strap before cutting.
2. Use flush cutters or small nippers to cut away the raised M5Stick retaining hooks, removing a little material at a time.
3. Trim any remaining burrs or sharp edges until the mount presents a flat bonding surface.
4. Clean and completely dry both the mount and the flat rear surface of the StopWatch.
5. Cut high-strength double-sided tape so it fits inside the mount footprint. Keep buttons, connectors, and openings clear.
6. Center the mount on the rear of the StopWatch, press it down firmly, and allow the adhesive to reach its specified bond strength.
7. Refit the nylon strap and perform a firm pull test before wearing it.

The conversion preserves the original StopWatch case and uses only the modified kit part plus adhesive. It makes the interface instantly available while moving around, not only when sitting at a desk.

## Impact and Usefulness

Vibe Watch removes tiny but frequent interruptions from AI-assisted work. It keeps multi-agent activity visible, reduces approval to a confident physical decision, and makes voice interaction instantly available—even away from the keyboard.

The same interaction model can extend beyond coding to accessibility tools, creative applications, multi-agent operations, and other workflows where attention is more valuable than screen space.
